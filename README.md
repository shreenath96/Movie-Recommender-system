# Movie-Recommender-system

The project aims to help users in the space of movie selection. Given the advent of the numerous online streaming platforms available with a new one rising every now and then, it is becoming harder for the users to decide which movies to watch. I implemented a standalone movie recommender system (not restricted to any streaming platform), that will allow a user to input a movie or a list of movies he/she has watched, and the recommender system outputs several movies based on the userâ€™s input.
